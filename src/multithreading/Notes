Concurrency
->java.util.concurrent (PACKAGE)
    1.Software that can perform multiple operations at a time are called concurrent software.
        For Ex-> Word Processor will always respond to mouse and keyboard events irrespective how busy it might be in
        formatting the content.
    2.Java Platform is built to support concurrent programming.

Processes and Threads
    1.A system always has active processes and thread. This is true for single core system also.
    2.In single core system only one thread executes at a time,all the thread share the single core of system via OS
        feature i.e Time Slicing.
->Processes
    1.Processes are often called programs or application.
    2.Each process has its own memory space.
    3.Communication b/w processes is done via Inter Process Communication(IPC), like pipes,sockets.
    4.In java we can create process using ProcessBuilder.

->Thread
    1.Threads are lightweight processes.
    2.All threads share the resources of a particular process they belong too.
    3.Creating a thread require less resources.
    4.Every Process has atleast one thread.
    5.By default Java Application has one thread called main thread that is capable of creating more threads.

-->Threads In Java
    1.Every thread in java is the instance of Thread Class.
    2.Two ways to create thread
        a.Directly manage and create the instance of thread class every time we need to create asynchronous task.
        b.Abstract the thread creation and pass the application task to executor.(Will see this later).
